d. List of known bugs: No bugs are known at this time. However, we are considering some enhancements: In the first cutscene 
we have added a page turning animation to reveal the interior of the house (set for the first level) as a bridge from the cutscene
to the level gameplay, and we are thinking of replacing the "Start Screen" in this animation with a picture of the house exterior 
without the title/buttons to not be confusing. Since the animation is a video, the buttons on the "Start Screen" here won't work and 
might be confusing, though this is not an actual bug. We may also add some particle effects to add to enemy deaths, player respawning, 
and/or the fans blowing (the last of which are currently static sprites and may look broken).
